    "# 7. Conclusion\n",
    "We've tested different models quickly, and identified two that could perform better than the others. We've selected parameters to improve the performance of these two models. We've selected a final model and we've evaluated its performance using several metrics. On the test set, the prediction performance of this model is very good when it comes to identify cases when C-section is required, and less on the prediction of cases when C-section is not required. The final model has a better performance than models of no-occurence of C-section and all occurence of C-section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further analysis could be:\n",
    "* With additional data, we might improve the performance of the model (as there were only 80 cases in the dataset).\n",
    "* Additional features of the pregnant women could also help improve the predictions.\n",
    "* We might as well test this model against a dataset coming from cases of pregnant women living in a different country (here, cases were recorded in Tabriz health center in Iran, as per the information found on the data source: __[see article](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/39b5/0ca364be9b851ff49c206bfd5d164085bc95.pdf)__ and __[this article](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Muhammad_Amin127/publication/329515048_Performance_Evaluation_of_Supervised_Machine_Learning_Classifiers_for_Predicting_Healthcare_Operational_Decisions/links/5c0c277aa6fdcc494fe4a3a6/Performance-Evaluation-of-Supervised-Machine-Learning-Classifiers-for-Predicting-Healthcare-Operational-Decisions.pdf?origin=publication_detail)__). In this case, we can wonder if results are affected by local practices followed by doctors, or even patients (?), who would for example prefer C-section over natural delivery even when health issues are not at stake.\n",
    "* Instead of using default parameters of the models when spot checking algoritms, we could assign specific parameters and re-assess what models would perform best. The outcome might be different, as for example in the articles cited above, authors claim that decision tree and KNN algorithms provide very good performances."
